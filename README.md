# Secret Word Game

## General Information

A game where the player needs to guess the hidden word.

## Instructions

- There are 5 attempts to discover the highest amount of words.
- Each time that a letter is informed but it is not present in the word the attempts are decreased. After 5 incorrect letters the game is over.
- The player can only add a single letter per attempt and if the letter was already used for the current word the application will notify it.
- When the word is revealed, the total score is increased by 100 and a new word will have to be discovered (if 5 words are discovered until the attempts are finished, the final score will be 500).
- Good luck!
